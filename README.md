# Monochrome studio
### My next simple website. I used basic of HTML, CSS (SCSS), and simple JS. The website looks good both on small devices such as phones and on large screens - tablets and computers.
### The website was created in accordance with the 'mobile first' principle. I only added basic brakepoints.
